# PokéWeather

Deployed Site : https://poke-weather-pr9zy4axq-prathameshthorat1729s-projects.vercel.app/

The objective of this project is to create a personal website using React that showcases your web development skills by displaying the current time, date, weather information, and dynamically fetched Pokémon cards. The home page should include features such as the current time and date, which updates every second, and weather information that includes temperature, weather condition, and location, refreshed every 10 minutes. Additionally, there should be a section displaying random tips or quotes that change periodically. For the Pokémon cards, the website should display them, allowing users to search for specific Pokémon by name. If the search bar is empty, all Pokémon cards should be displayed and filtered based on the search query.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
